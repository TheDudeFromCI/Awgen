# Awgen

Awgen is a Java-based game engine, developed by Wraithaven Games. The engine is built around the concept of mixing various plugins to make games through a realtime multiplayer environment.

### What is it?

Awgen is a game engine built around the focus of building plugin-based games through a multiplayer environment. The engine allows for users to setup a local server and allow multiple individuals to connect and build onto the game in real time. Developers can create plugins to add to the server to add custom functions and editors to the engine to build more dynmaic games. These games can be then published as single player or multiplayer games.

The goal in mind when developing this engine was to push the concept of creating full length game environments using simple plugins and mods working together. Because of this system, it is possible for individuals with little to no experience to create creative games to explore and play with. With the engine being open source, anyone is allowed to build any plugin they wish for the engine and can distribute the combination as a full length game.

### Why use it?

Yes, there's a lot of other game engines out there. Most are significantly nicer than this one. But the goal of Awgen is not to compete with them, but to offer a fun new way to develop games. There are many advantages for using Awgen over writing your own engine. Awgen takes care of most of the low level game engine code. So you don't need to worry about loading the correct rendering engine, or tweaking optimization for hours. You can dive right into the higher level game logic. It's the feel of making games that should come as naturally as playing games.

### Is this project open source?

Yes! The project, while maintained by Wraithaven Games, can be contributed to by anyone. This project is meant to be a fun experience for everyone to enjoy. If you have some ideas you want to push forth, or have some features you've been itching to see published, let's see what you've got. Simply make a fork of the project and let's see that you come up with.

Please note, that not all pull requests will be accepted. Code quality and core features are very important, so your code will be heavily reviewed before accepting. Some features may fit better as a plugin for example, and will be requested to be published as a plugin instead. Other features may conflict with the core direction of the project, or may require heavy editing before being considered. If you're not sure about what's allowed and what's not allowed, contact us at wraithavengames@gmail.com, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. We're here to help!
