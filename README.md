# Awgen

Awgen is a Java-based, multiplayer, sandbox game, developed by Wraithaven Games, built on top of WraithEngine. Awgen is a game designed for the sole purpose of creating games as you play. It's designed to remove the monotony from various parts of game development and allow users to create games casually and have fun doing it. You don't need to know how to create 3D models or textures, or code to use Awgen. And everything you make can be published into a full, stand-alone game. Make something cool? Put it in an game marketplace. Or host an MMO and allow anyone to join.

### What is it?

Awgen is a game engine built around the focus of building games in a sandbox environment with a multiplayer setting. The game allows for users to setup a local server and allow multiple individuals to connect and build onto the game in real time, or simply play the game single player. Developers can create plugins to add to the server to add custom functions and editors to the engine to build more dynmaic games. These games can be then published as single player or multiplayer games.

The goal in mind when developing this engine was to push the concept of creating full length game environments using simple plugins and mods working together, and bringing casual game development to as high a level as possible. Because of this system, it is possible for individuals with little to no experience to create creative games to explore and play with. With the game being open source, anyone is allowed to build anything they wish and share it with anyone or publish it anywhere.

### Why use it?

Awgen is a game in itself, not just a game engine. It's about making games and having fun doing it. It's built around allowing casual users to be creative and express themselves without having to rely on the experience or skills that are often assossiated with larger development teams and studios. It's designed for players who want to try their hand at creating something amazing without worrying about the fine details or studying skills or workflows or overwhelming themselves with which way is up. You simply jump on and start building.
